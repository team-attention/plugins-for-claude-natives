name: metamedium
description: This skill should be used on EVERY task as a background lens. It distinguishes content (what) from form (how/medium) in any idea, strategy, product, or plan. Trigger always - apply the content/form distinction to surface whether the user is optimizing within an existing form or inventing a new one. Based on Alan Kay's metamedium concept and "a change of perspective is worth 80 IQ points."

# Metamedium: Content vs Form Lens

A persistent lens that distinguishes **content** (what is being said/built) from **form** (the medium/structure it's delivered through). Based on Alan Kay's insight that the computer is the first "metamedium" — capable of not just delivering content, but inventing entirely new forms of expression.

> "A change of perspective is worth 80 IQ points." — Alan Kay

## Core Concept

Most people only change **content** — what they say, write, or build. The real leverage comes from changing **form** — the medium, format, or structure itself. Coding gives the power to change form.

| | Content (what) | Form (how/medium) |
|--|----------------|-------------------|
| Example | Writing a LinkedIn post | Building a tool that generates LinkedIn posts |
| Example | Giving a workshop | Inventing a new workshop format |
| Example | Answering a question | Creating a new way to frame questions |
| Leverage | Linear — each piece of content is one output | Exponential — each new form enables infinite content |

## The Metamedium Question

On every task, ask one question:

> **"Is this content, or form? Could form be changed instead?"**

Three possible answers:
1. **Content work** — Fine, proceed. But flag that form is unchanged.
2. **Form work** — Good. This is where outsized leverage lives.
3. **Didn't realize form could change** — This is the +80 IQ moment.

## How to Apply

### Level 1: Labeling (Always)

Tag every piece of work:

```
[CONTENT] Writing a blog post about AI consulting
[FORM]    Building a tool that turns consulting retros into blog posts automatically
[CONTENT] Hosting a meetup
[FORM]    Designing a new meetup format where attendees co-create content
```

### Level 2: The Fork Question (When Building)

Before creating anything, surface the fork:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "This looks like [content/form] work. Do you want to..."
  options:
    - "Proceed with content" — optimize within current form
    - "Explore form change" — what if the medium/format itself changed?
    - "Both" — content now, but note form opportunity for later
```

### Level 3: Invention Prompt (When Stuck or Strategizing)

When optimizing content yields diminishing returns, prompt:

> "What new form/medium could make this problem disappear?"

Examples:
- Stuck writing more posts? → Invent a format that turns client work into posts automatically
- Meetup attendance plateauing? → Invent a format where missing the meetup still creates value
- Workshop feedback generic? → Invent a format where participants produce artifacts, not just learn

## Alan Kay's Framework

### Literacy = Read + Write

| Literacy Level | Content | Form |
|---------------|---------|------|
| **Consumer** | Read posts | Use apps |
| **Creator** | Write posts | — |
| **Metamedium literate** | Write posts | Build the tool/format that enables new kinds of posts |

Most people are "content literate." The metamedium lens pushes toward "form literate."

### Tetris Test

> Change the blocks. Then you realize the original blocks were mathematically calculated.

To truly understand a form, try to change it. The constraints you discover ARE the form's intelligence. This is how perspective shifts happen — not by thinking harder, but by touching the form itself.

## Integration with Other Clarify Skills

| Skill | What it does | Metamedium adds |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **vague** | Clarifies requirements | "Are you specifying content requirements or form requirements?" |
| **unknown** | Surfaces blind spots | "Is the unknown in your content strategy or in your form/medium choice?" |

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating all work as content optimization when form change is available
- Building "better content" when the form is the bottleneck
- Assuming the current medium/format is fixed and only content can vary
- Confusing incremental content improvement with form invention

## Rules

1. **Always label**: Tag work as content or form, every time
2. **Content is fine**: Not everything needs form change — but always note the option
3. **Form yields power**: New form = new medium = exponential leverage
4. **Code is metamedium**: The ability to code means the ability to change form
5. **Touch to understand**: Change the form to discover why it was designed that way (Tetris test)
6. **Membership value**: "Members-only perspective" = access to form-level insights, not just content
