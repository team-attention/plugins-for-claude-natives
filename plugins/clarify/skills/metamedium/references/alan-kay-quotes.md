# Alan Kay: Source Quotes and Context

Key quotes and context that inform the metamedium lens.

## "A change of perspective is worth 80 IQ points"

**Origin**: July 1982, lecture to the Apple Macintosh team. Recorded by Andy Hertzfeld.

**Context**: The Dynabook team at Xerox PARC sought truly innovative approaches to computing. Kay believed having a new way of seeing a problem is the most effective way of moving to a solution — more effective than raw intelligence applied to the same perspective.

**Application**: When stuck, don't think harder. Change the frame. The content/form distinction IS such a frame change.

## "The best way to predict the future is to invent it"

**Origin**: 1971, Xerox PARC.

**Context**: At PARC, the researchers' maxim encouraged a proactive approach — rather than predicting what might happen based on current trends, create new technologies that define future possibilities.

**Application**: Don't optimize content within existing forms. Invent new forms.

## "The computer is the first metamedium"

**Origin**: 1977, "Personal Dynamic Media" paper by Alan Kay and Adele Goldberg.

**Full quote**: "The computer is the first metamedium, and as such it has degrees of freedom for representation and expression never before encountered and as yet barely investigated."

**Context**: Kay realized computers could simulate ALL existing media (text, images, music, film) AND create entirely new media that had never existed before. This is what he called "metamedium" — a medium that contains and generates other media.

**Application**: Coding doesn't just let you create content faster. It lets you invent new kinds of media. This is qualitatively different from any previous tool.

## On Literacy

**Quote**: "The ability to 'read' a medium means you can access materials and tools generated by others. The ability to 'write' in a medium means you can generate materials and tools for others. You must have both to be literate."

**Application**: True computer literacy is not using apps (reading). It's creating new forms of expression and tools for others (writing). Most "AI literacy" today is reading-level only (using ChatGPT). Form-level literacy means building new AI-powered formats.

## On New Representations

**Quote**: "These new media use already existing representational formats as their building blocks, while adding many new previously nonexistent properties."

**Application**: The most powerful innovations don't replace existing forms — they use them as building blocks to create something with properties that didn't exist before. Example: A tool that combines consulting retros + AI + LinkedIn into an automatic content pipeline isn't just "better content." It's a new form with properties (automatic, repeatable, scalable) that the individual components didn't have.
